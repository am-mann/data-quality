#######################  May 12, 2025  #########################
Summary: Today read the literature on garbage codes and quality of death data index, I set up Github, I played around with codes, and I went through the dataset to get a sense of it.
Hours: 11am - 7pm

ANACONDA is an existing index from 2020 measuring the quality of death data (meant for a global context). Citation:  Mikkelsen, L., Moesgaard, K., Hegnauer, M. et al. ANACONDA: a new tool to improve mortality and cause of death data. BMC Med 18, 61 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-020-01521-0
        - On Google Scholar, I went through all the papers that cite it and I didn’t find any           applying it to the US or doing the kind of in-depth demographic anaylsis Monica suggested
        -It’s also possible that it’s not entirely appropriate to evaluate data quality in a             higher income country like the US since it was intented for global use

How Anaconda works: 
The five components that make up the index are as follows:
1.Completeness of death registration
2.* Fraction of ‘garbage’ codes in the data
3.* Amount of COD detail in the COD list used
4.Extent to which age and sex of deceased are not recorded
5.* Number of biologically implausible causes found in the data (i.e. highly unlikely of impossible causes for a given age-sex category)
- Should include R99 (no cause of death specified)
- Autopsy rate
- Also, look at severity of data poor quality


Types of garbage codes (Mikkelsen et al, 2020):
Category 1: Codes relating to symptoms, signs and ill-defined conditions (most drawn from ICD Chapter XVIII); e.g. R99 Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality).

Category 2: Codes that are not valid as an underlying cause of death (e.g. T12 Fracture of lower limb).

Category 3: Codes that represent intermediate causes of death (e.g. I50 Heart failure).

Category 4: Codes that represent immediate causes of death (e.g. I46 Cardiac arrest).

Category 5: Codes that represent insufficiently specified causes within ICD chapters or within a larger disease category (e.g. D48.9 Neoplasm of uncertain or unknown behaviour, unspecified).


ANACONDA also includes a second typology, which focuses much more on the potential impact that garbage codes might have on misguiding policy and planning (Naghavi 2020). In this typology, garbage codes are grouped into four impact levels, from “very high” (level 1) to “low” (level 4):

Very high (level 1): This highest level represents causes for which the true underlying cause could be a communicable or non-communicable disease, or the result of an injury (e.g. septicaemia).

High (level 2): These are causes with substantial negative impact, but where the true cause is mostly limited to one of the three broad cause groups mentioned above, e.g. essential (primary) hypertension that can be due to different non-communicable diseases.

Medium (level 3): CODs classified to the third level are only considered to have a medium negative impact for policy since, in this case, the underlying cause is likely to be within the same ICD chapter (e.g. unspecified cancer).

Low (level 4): Causes classified as having low negative impact are those where the true underlying cause is likely to be confined to a single disease of injury group, such as unspecified stroke or unspecified pneumonia.

Other interesting papers on quality of death data:
From Norway: https://tidsskriftet.no/en/2015/05/perspectives/data-quality-causes-death-registry
Pedersen, A. G., & Ellingsen, C. L. (2015). Data quality in the Causes of Death Registry. Tidsskrift for Den norske legeforening.

Things that are important to consider in data quality: Degree of coverage (what percentage of the population is covered in registry) and completeness (how complete the information in the registry is for a given person) “garbage codes”.

Infrequency of autopsies: According to Alfsen et 2013, autopsies changed the underlying cause  of death in 61% of cases in Norway and 32% of cases to another chapter (this is a bit biased because when do autopsies occur?)

Electronic healthcare records (Pederson 2015) and AI could be important tools in standarization 
Could we use AI to predict what the correct death certificates could be?

This could address the problem of the distinction between underlying cause of death and immediate cause of death (e.g. lung cancer v.s. pneumonia)

This could also address the problem autopsies changing the underlying cause of death (what if we use the autopsy group to predict which percentage of death certificates in the non-autopsy group are probably wrong and should be changed?)

How correlated is the rate of autopsy changes with the ANACONDA index?

Finally, it would be interesting to see if LLMs do a better job coding. Currently, what occurs is that the doctors describe the sequence of events which are then coded by trained coders.

See how well the various metrics predict each other. 


Important Paper: Flagg, L. A., & Anderson, R. N. (2021). Unsuitable underlying causes of death for assessing the quality of cause-of-death reporting.
        - This paper looks at the cause of death reporting in the US and breaks it down by demographics and location. However, it only looks at garbage code and not the rest of the ANACONDA index. 
        
        
############### THINGS TO DISCUSS IN MEETING WITH MONICA ###########################
1. How do you measure the true CDR? Go through slide 14
3. Need to get access to ANACONDA (the link is broken)
4. Discuss the Flagg & Anderson, 2021 paper. Don't want our work to be redundant.
5. Having trouble downloading the data from 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021
6. Ask Monica about timesheets and if this format for logging hours is okay

Next meeting: 
- Tuesday or Wednesday

MAY 15
- 9 -11: worked on calculating completeness
